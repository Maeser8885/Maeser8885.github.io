We are a group of around 15 students from all around Utah county, most of which attend Karl G Maeser Preparatory Academy.  
Founded in 2021, our rookie year was 2022, competing in FRC Rapid React. 
We qualified for nationals in Houston Texas after earning the Rookie All Star award at our the Utah Regional. We went, learned a lot, and got to meet many great teams and awesome robots.  
We are now in our fourth year of competing, and are working on getting much better as a team as we learn from previous
mistakes and new experiences.
